## Semantic Tags 

A semantic tag/element are tags that have a meaning. Many websites contain different semantic tags/elements to define different parts of a web page. 

**Examples of non-semantic tags/elements:**
`<div>` and  `<span>` --> These elements tells us(developers) and the browser nothing about it's content. This is where attributes come in handy to specify what the content will be consisted of by allowing you to add classes, an id or some in-line styling. 

**Examples of semantic tags/elements:**
`<form>`, `<table>` or `<article>` --> These elements clearly tells us(developers) and the browser about the type of content it will produce.
