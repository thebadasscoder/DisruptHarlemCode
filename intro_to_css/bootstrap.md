## How To Make Your Webpage Look Good using Bootstrap

**Bootstrap** is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web. Bootstrap 4 is the latest version. It has a lot of new exciting features and capabilities that make building responsive designs even easier than before. The biggest add-on is that it is heavily built on **Flexbox**


## Adding Bootstrap to HTML 
Bootstrap uses HTML elements and CSS properties that require the HTML5 doctype.

Always include the HTML5 doctype at the beginning of the page, along with the lang attribute and the correct character set

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css">
`

## Bootstrap is Mobile-First 
It can be used for design to be responsive to mobile devices. In order for you to achieve this you have to include the following `<meta>` tag inside of your `<head>` element: 

`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">`

The `width=device-width ` part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).

The `initial-scale=1` part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.
