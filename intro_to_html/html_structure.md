## HTML Syntax & Structure 

The HTML document is made up of different elements which help to structure the content in which you want to display on your screen. 

`
<!DOCTYPE html>
	<head> 
	<title>
	</title> 
	</head>
	<body>
	</body>
</html>
`

Think of a HTML document as the blueprint of your web page. 

## The Basic HTML Structure

The `<!DOCTYPE>` represents the document type and helps browsers to display web pages correctly. This is always the first element you want to write first.  

The `<head>` element is the root of your HTML page. It is the second most important element you need when writing your HTML page. It is where you will insert the next element down below. 

The `<title>` specifes a title for your HTML document. 


The `<body>` contains all the content that you want to see on your page. This includes your h1, paragrah, img tags etc.. 


**Remember! every open tag has a closing tag.**
