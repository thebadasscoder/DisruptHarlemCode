## Using Images 

To simply use an image inside of your html file, you have to defined the image tag. 

`<img>`

This tag contains attributes only and does not have a closing tag. 


## HTML 

`<img src="url">` 

The `src` attribute specifies the **URL(link)** of the image. 
The `alt` provides an alternate text/name for the image. This will never been seen when an image is display on your web page. 


## Try It Out! 

* Put at least 3 different images on your screen and try to make them different sizes.
